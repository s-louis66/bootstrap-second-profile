# bootstrap-second-profile
Bootstrap profile page that I made from scratch. Also includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I was originally going to make this my live profile webpage but ran into a small bug with
the linking that really bothered me and have had a difficult time trying to fix so I decided
to finish my mock1 profile page instead to go live. This page was almost done except for that
small bug so I consider this a full project. Check it out at solluis.com.
